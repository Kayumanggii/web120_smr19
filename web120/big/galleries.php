<p>A photo gallery can be set up by using only HTML and CSS by placing each image into a container and classifying each container which then allows elements to be designed by CSS. A designer can then add descriptions to make the divs react in various ways such as when hovering over the image. These galleries can be responsive with the size and layout of each image depending on the size of the view screen.</p>

<p>Creating responsive galleries is an essential aspect of web design nowadays. Especially if you are creating a website that is photo heavy such as a portfolio or a photography website. With the various HTML galleries available, it is truly difficult to determine which is the best to use for the project that you are creating. There are free and premium galleries available. If you are creating a personal project you might be more keen to use a free version however if you are creating a project for an occupation, you most likely want to impress your clients with an outstanding premium gallery that would cost you some money.</p>

<p>One of the best JQuery image slideshows is the AviaSlider. This is a image slideshow plugin made with jQuery that very simple and flexible to use. What makes this image slideshow more unique than its competitors is how the transitions are built. It has a built in image preloader in order for the slider to start working only when the images are loaded and set to be presented.</p>
