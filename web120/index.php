     <p>My name is Clara and I am pursuing an Associate in Applied Sciences in Web Design at Seattle Central College. On the days that I am not at school, or working, I enjoy sewing, playing with my pets, crocheting and cooking especially Filipino food.</p>

     <p>Once I complete the Web Design program, I would like to become a Front End Developer. I consider myself as a creative individual and I would like to express my creativity through designing websites.
